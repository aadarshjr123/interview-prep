# Arrays & Strings (Refresher)

## Arrays

-   Elements are stored in **contiguous memory** (side by side).
-   **Access**: O(1) → Direct index lookup.
-   **Insert/Delete (middle)**: O(n) → Because elements need shifting.

## Strings

-   In Python/JS, strings are **immutable** → change = make new string.
-   Common operations:
    -   **Slicing** → `s[1:4]`
    -   **Reversing** → `s[::-1]`
    -   **Concatenation** → `"a" + "b"`
